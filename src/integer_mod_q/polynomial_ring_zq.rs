//! [`PolynomialRingZq`] is a type of ring over PolyOverZq/f(X).
//! Where f(X) is a [`PolyOverZq`](crate::integer_mod_q::PolyOverZq).
//! This implementation uses the [FLINT](https://flintlib.org/) library.
//!
//! For **DEVELOPERS**: Many functions assume that the [`PolynomialRingZq`] instances are reduced.
//! To avoid unnecessary checks and reductions, always return canonical/reduced
//! values. The end-user should be unable to obtain a non-reduced value.
//! Therefore, the DEVELOPER has to call the [`PolynomialRingZq::reduce`], whenever
//! a computation may exceed the modulus, because it is not reduced automatically
